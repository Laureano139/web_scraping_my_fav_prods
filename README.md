# Web Scraping My Favorite Products

A small Python project to fetch product prices from KuantoKusta and receive email notifications.

The products to monitor are stored in a JSON file (name and link).

I also implemented a github action so this script runs automatically at 08:00 UTC, 09:00 in Portugal, and 13:00 UTC, 14:00 in Portugal.
